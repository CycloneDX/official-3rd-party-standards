# Official Third-Party Standards and Requirements

This repository contains official third-party standards that have been transformed into CycloneDX v1.6 (draft) requirements.
These requirements are intended to document compliance to a standard in a machine readable format that is consistent with
the CycloneDX Specification. This allows delivery of Software Bill of Materials and compliance to industry standards in a
consistent manner.
